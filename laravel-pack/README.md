# VSCode Laravel Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.png)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make Laravel editing easier and fun.

The best Laravel extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode Laravel** pack includes:

* [Laravel Artisan](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryannaddy.laravel-artisan)
* [Laravel Blade formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shufo.vscode-blade-formatter)
* [Laravel Blade Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onecentlin.laravel-blade)
* [Laravel Extra Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amiralizadeh9480.laravel-extra-intellisense)
* [Laravel goto view](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codingyu.laravel-goto-view)
