# VSCode NPM Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.png)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make NPM editing easier and fun.

The best NPM extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode NPM** pack includes:

* [npm](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.vscode-npm-script)
* [npm Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense)
* [Search node_modules](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasonnutter.search-node-modules)

**Enjoy!**
