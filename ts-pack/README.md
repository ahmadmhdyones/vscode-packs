# VSCode TypeScript Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.jpeg)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make TypeScript editing easier and fun.

The best TypeScript extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode TypeScript** pack includes:

* [Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport)
* [Sass/Less/Stylus/Pug/Jade/Typescript/Javascript Compile Hero Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wscats.eno)
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)

**Enjoy!**
