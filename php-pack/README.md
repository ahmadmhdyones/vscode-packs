# VSCode PHP Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.jpg)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make PHP editing easier and fun.

The best PHP extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode PHP** pack includes:

* [Format HTML in PHP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rifi2k.format-html-in-php)
