# VSCode Git Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.png)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make Git controling easier and fun.

The best Git extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode Git** pack includes:

* [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)
* [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)
* [gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore)
* [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

**Enjoy!**
