# VSCode Test Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.jpg)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make Test process easier and fun.

The best Test extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode Test** pack includes:

* [Test Adapter Converter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.test-adapter-converter)
* [Test Explorer UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer)

**Enjoy!**
