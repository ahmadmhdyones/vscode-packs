# VSCode Markdown Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.jpg)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make Markdown editing easier and fun.

The best markdown extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode Markdown** pack includes:

* [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
* [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
* [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
