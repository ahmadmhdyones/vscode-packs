# VSCode JSON Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.webp)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make JSON editing easier and fun.

The best JSON extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode JSON** pack includes:

* [json](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZainChen.json)
* [Paste JSON as Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quicktype.quicktype)
* [Prettify JSON](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohsen1.prettify-json)
* [Sort JSON objects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richie5um2.vscode-sort-json)
* [XML to JSON](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?item=buianhthang.xml2json)

**Enjoy!**
