# VSCode C++ Pack

![Banner](assets/banner.png)

This extension pack adds more features to VS Code! These are some of my favorite extensions to make C++ editing easier and fun.

The best C++ extensions for Visual Studio Code are now available as a single package, so you don't have to manually install them one by one.

I love building tools that make developers productive!

The **VSCode C++** pack includes:

* [Better C Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeff-hykin.better-c-syntax)
